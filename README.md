# Java_Rock_Paper_Scissors
This is a Rock, Paper &amp; Scissors game that I made as a final project for my college Java class.


This is the first screen, where we can choose if we want to start the game or quit...

Here I have the game screen, where we can play, I just have to choose my move, and then the code will generate a random computer move.
And then the code will say who have won this round, and we need to click the button "next round" to go to the next round.

We play 3 rounds for the final score...

This is the last screen, showing the final scores.
